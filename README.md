# 💼 Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction using Hybrid Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an advanced **Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction System** using hybrid machine learning techniques. The model combines Gradient Boosting algorithms with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to improve prediction accuracy and handle class imbalance effectively.

The system uses financial datasets from **Taiwan** and **Poland**, merges them into a unified dataset, and deploys the best-performing model using **Streamlit** for real-time bankruptcy risk prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict corporate bankruptcy risk using financial ratios.
- Handle highly imbalanced financial datasets.
- Improve prediction accuracy using hybrid ML models.
- Optimize classification threshold using PSO.
- Provide an interactive web-based prediction system.
